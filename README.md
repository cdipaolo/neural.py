## `neural.py`
#### sklearn compatable feedforward neural network libary with versatile settings

Neural.py is a versatile, easy to use, and fast feedforward neural network library using the same API as sklearn. All computations are (as much as possible) fully matrix based and rely on numpy for underlying computation.

Included in the repository is an MNIST example, which shows how to use the library easily. Training is very fast (subjectively) and within a minute or two you can get over 97% test set accuracy on my Macbook Air. Within the notebook you can also see a bunch of the least confident predictions to see some errors in the network. Many different archetectures are evaluated and a ReLu network with 3 hidden layers can get 98.32% test set accuracy.
